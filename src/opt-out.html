        If you opt out, you will not get any local emergency alerts.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You cannot choose the type of hazard you want to get alerts about. If you opt out because you do not want flood warnings, you’ll miss alerts for fires and terrorist incidents as well.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Because of this, we recommend you keep emergency alerts switched on for your own safety.
